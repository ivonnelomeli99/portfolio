## MY EXPERIENCE
### Tecnologico de Monterrey – Nano Structured Materials Lab, 2022 - 2023
Thesis student
- Fabrication of materials with applications in desalination processes and energy storage for batteries.
- I developed the research proposal, experimental design and methodology optimization for 3 different experiments, each with different precursors.
- I was responsible for managing laboratory resources, following time constraints, give weekly follow-up presentations on my progress, and write a final article with the complete research. [Click here to view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1viunEW09WzWtncmV0bKshwvO-RRwNOqG/view?usp=sharing)

### Grupo AlEn, 2022
Prototype Testing Intern
- I proposed and implemented image analysis with MATLAB to facilitate cleaning product evaluations.
- Through color image analysis I calculated the percentage of dirtyness on a surface, and compared it to similar products to determine the most effective.
